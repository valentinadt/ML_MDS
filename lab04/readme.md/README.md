# Recommendation System Project


A recommendation system is an intelligent system that provides users with a series of personalised suggestions (recommendations) on a certain type of items. They study the characteristics of each user and by processing the data, find a subset of items that may be of interest to the user. Today, there are many known cases of use of these technologies in large companies such as Netflix, Spotify or Amazon.

The aim of this project is to know this Machine Learning technique better and to test its effectiveness by building some models with which:
- make movies recommendations
- predict their success by predicting the scores that will be given by the users to whom the recommendation has been made

For this purpose, we have used a dataset provided by MovieLens (https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/25m/) that consists of 25 million ratings and one million tag applications applied to 62,000 movies by 162,000 users.

The data are contained in the files 'genome-scores.csv', 'genome-tags.csv', 'links.csv', 'movies.csv', 'ratings.csv' and 'tags.csv'. However, only the last three have been used in the analysis as they contain the data necessary to achieve our goal.

The steps followed in this project have been:

- Loading and exploring the data (EDA).

- Feature engineering.

- Construction and evaluation of recommendation model based on content.

- Construction and evaluation of recommendation models based on collaborative filtering: SVD, User-Based model and Item-Based model with KNN algorithm.

- Conclusions.
